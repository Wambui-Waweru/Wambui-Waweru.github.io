              <div class="multiline">In this project, I designed an interface for an emerging startup. This project is split into three parts:

                  (2) converging into an interactive, high fidelity prototype
                  (3) conducting User Testing on this final prototype.

                <h2>Problem</h2>Chosen Startup: Prenda
                <p>
                  1.     Purpose of Startup:  Prenda is a startup that focuses on providing an alternative to 
                  traditional schools such as microschools that can be personalized to every student’s style of learning. It is a hybrid 
                  of home school and traditional school with an emphasis on project-based learning. It provides teachers 
                  or Guides (as they refer to them) with all the necessary material and support to create the best
                  environment for students to learn, grow and build lifelong skills.

                  2.     Type of interface on which to design: Responsive website mainly directed towards teachers/guides 
                  for planning, organized and ordering material for their class

              <h2>Design Iterations</h2>

              <div class="multiline">
                <p>Sketches
                  It’s impossible to come up with the perfect design in one go and so I created different sketches to help 
                  me visualize ideas, consider alternate designs, and avoid premature decision making. Here are some 
                  sketches that I came up with.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="multiline">
                <p>Prototypes
                  I made an interactive “high-fidelity”(hi-fi) prototype based off the sketches I created above. Unlike the 
                  sketches, this hi-fi prototype is an exact representation of the interface.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2>Design Choices</h2>
              <div class="multiline">
                <p>
                  For the hi-fi prototype, my primary color is orange because it is bright, playful and fitting for a “micro school” 
                  website. The other accent colors are black and white that are used for the text. I have two 
                  separate home pages where one informs general users about what Prenda is while the other home page 
                  is the logged in version for the teacher/guide. Once a teacher/guide has logged in, I have hi-fi prototypes of screens 
                  for ordering school supplies, managing courses, viewing assignments and 
                  grade report of students in addition to email and calendar.
                  Since ordering school supplies and checking email is a frequent task that the guides will do, I have 
                  made the pages accessible from any part of the website by having permanent clickable icons on the top 
                  left corner. From a guides perspective, the most important navigation bars are courses and assignments 
                  which are placed at the center of the navigation tabs. Moreover, since Prenda focuses on personalized 
                  learning, I have incorporated a page that allows guides to customize their course to fit each of their 
                  student’s way of learning.

              <h2>User Testing</h2>
              <div class="multiline">
                <p>
                  To test out the usability, visual design, and responsiveness of my website, I had test participants try out 
                  the interface and provide feedback. Here is the test plan with the tasks I asked each user to complete.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Below is a breakdown of the time taken by each user to complete the three tasks explained above.
              </p>
              <p>
                And here is a breakdown of User Satisfaction (measured via analyzing ease of completion)

                  Qualitative analysis of results [Errors (slips, lapses, or mistakes), and how satisfied users 
                  were when completing the tasks]:

                  Completing the first task to find Arts & Crafts under assignments was a struggle for all the users because 
                  the first screen is the homepage where the guide is not yet logged in. They all tried to find the 
                  assignments in different tabs before trying to log in. Once logged in they completed the tasks pretty 
                  quickly. Another common point of confusion was when the users tried to customize courses. The button to 
                  do so (Edit chapter) was intuitive to them but when they received no response from the button, two of 
                  them interpreted that as a mistake. No user struggled to find the calendar, and all ranked the task as very 
                  easy.

            </div>
            <div class="changes">
              <h2>Potential Design Changes</h2>
              <div class="multiline">
                <p>
                  Increasing the accessibility of my site by increasing the contrast. Users have noted that while they like the color palette, the site may be too monochrome for those with visual impairments and some text was hard to read. Going forward, I would look more closely at web content accessibility guidelines to see what color combinations achieve better visual clarity.
                  One user noted that the site gave an early “2010” feel, so to further make it a more modern site, I could reference popular modern websites for inspiration. Many of which go for a minimal, and flat appearance with simple and high contrast colors.
                  Improve consistency in regard to visual appearance as the fonts being of different types and sizes make the site a bit jarring.
                  Regarding overall layout, when watching users interact with my prototype, I noticed them getting a bit confused with navigation. In particular, it took a bit for users to figure out how to go from the landing page to the logged in page. I can make this process easier by increasing the size of the login buttons as well as making the overall buttons on the page in a more predictable layout. By predictability, users have noted that they would have liked the buttons on the page to not be so spread out as some go on pages only to get confused momentarily looking for the next button to click such as what happened with the “customize course” button, which was on the upper right hand corner of the page but could be moved to the top left corner instead because in general most of our users would be reading the screen from left to right.
